# ANLY5550 - Final Project
Author: Huiting Song

Analyzing the factors influence solar irradiation sources and forecasting the electric power generation using ML algorithms. The variability of environmental conditions, such as temperature, and the episodic nature of renewable energy sources present a significant challenge in maximizing solar power production. Learning the factors influence the generation of solar power is essential to enhance the electric power production and contribution to the energy network, thus enabling the shift to a more sustainable energy.

The structure of the repository:
- **Code** : including any code works for data processing and modeling.
- **Data** : including any data resources that are used in this project.
<br>-- Raw : Potential data sources without processing and will potientially be used in this project.
<br>-- Cleaned : Used data sources after data wraggling
- **Visualization** : including the graphs and plots from data visualization.
- **Carbon Cost**: The carbon cost documents from running the coding file.
