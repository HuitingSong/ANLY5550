# ANLY5550 - Final Project
Author: Huiting Song

This project focuses on optimizing the energy output of renewable energy sources, specifically wind and solar power, using ML algorithms and then analyzing the carbon emission generated by electrical power used. 

The structure of the repository:
- **Code** : including any code works for data processing and model training.
<br>-- Raw : Potential data sources without processing
<br>-- Cleaned : Used data sources after data wraggling
- **Data** : including any data resources that are used in this project.
- **Visualization** : including the graphs and plots from data visualization.
